A website that takes the number of steps taken, translates it to distance and displays that distance on a 3d interactive globe. 
As this is to be used as a religious education tool, a number of a religious landmarks have also been plotted and displayed accorss the globe. 
Their positions and locations are plotted using coordinates translated to fit the 3d represnetation of the globe. 
The markers for the landmarks are also interactive and move with the globe always ensuring they are positionally accurate.
Simple UI for teachers/educators, data is inputted using Excel (or an attatching form) that is then made intoa csv which is read by the program.
